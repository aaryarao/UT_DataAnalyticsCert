## Foodhub analysis - Python

This project showcases the use of pandas and effective visualizations for data analysis in Python. The project includes a Jupyter notebook with examples of uni and multivariate analyses, as well as answers to important data driven questions.

### Tools and Libraries Used
The following tools and libraries were used for this project:

- Python 3
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

### Contents
The Jupyter notebook in this repository includes the following sections:

- Data Preparation: This section covers loading data into pandas dataframes, cleaning and transforming data, and handling missing values.

- Univariate Analysis: This section shows how to create effective visualizations for exploring individual variables in a dataset, including histograms, boxplots, and density plots.

- Multivariate Analysis: This section demonstrates how to visualize relationships between multiple variables in a dataset, using scatterplots, line charts, and heatmaps with clustering.

- Data Driven Questions: This section answers important questions by applying the techniques covered to specific applications within this dataset.

### Conclusion
By completing the analysis above on this notebook, I effectively used pandas and visualization strategies to gain insights from the data, explore relationships between variables, and create actionable insights to guide our next steps.

## New Wheels - SQL

This project showcases the use of advanced SQL joins and common table expressions (CTEs) for cleaning and manipulating an automobile dataset. The contained SQL queries are used to extract insights from the data.

### Tools and Libraries Used
The following tools and libraries were used for this project:

- SQL (Structured Query Language)

### Contents
The completion of the SQL script in this repository required the use of the following concepts:

- Data Preparation: This section loads the new wheels automobile file into a SQL server instance, cleaning and transforming the data, and ensuring that appropriate indexes are present to optimize query performance.

- Advanced Joins: This section demonstrates how to use advanced SQL joins, including outer joins, self-joins, and subqueries, to combine data from multiple tables and extract insights from the dataset.

- Common Table Expressions (CTEs): This section shows how to use CTEs to simplify complex queries and improve readability.

- Data Analysis: This section applies the techniques covered in the previous sections to analyze the automobile dataset, including identifying the most popular car models, examining the relationships between car features, and finding anomalies in the data.

### Conclusion
By following this SQL project I used advanced SQL joins and CTEs to clean and manipulate data, extract insights, and perform complex data analysis tasks. These skills are valuable for working with relational databases and SQL, and can be applied to a wide range of real-world problems.
